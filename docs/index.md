**Python package for nanopore DNA methylation analysis downstream to Nanopolish**

`pycoMeth` is a downstream methylation analysis package for [Nanopolish](https://github.com/jts/nanopolish).

It can be used for further analyses of the output files generated by Nanopolish call-methylation.

---

The package contains the following modules:

* [CpG_Aggregate](CpG_Aggregate/usage): Aggregate the output of `nanopolish call-methylation` at genomic position level.

* [Interval_Aggregate](Interval_Aggregate/usage): Bin the output of `pycoMeth CpG_Aggregate` in genomic intervals, using either an annotation file or a sliding window.

* [Meth_Comp](Meth_Comp/usage): Compare Methylation level between several samples from either `pycoMeth CpG_Aggregate` or `pycoMeth Interval_Aggregate`.
