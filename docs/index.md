**DNA methylation analysis downstream to Nanopolish for Oxford Nanopore DNA sequencing datasets**

`pycoMeth` can be used for further analyses starting from the output files generated by [`Nanopolish call-methylation`](https://github.com/jts/nanopolish). The package contains a suite of tools to **find CpG islands** calculate the **methylation probability at CpG dinucleotide or CpG island resolution** across the entire genome and to perform a **simple differential methylation analysis** across multiple samples.

The package contains the following modules:

* [CpG_Aggregate](CpG_Aggregate/usage): Aggregate the output of `nanopolish call-methylation` at genomic position level.
* [Interval_Aggregate](Interval_Aggregate/usage): Bin the output of `pycoMeth CpG_Aggregate` in genomic intervals, using either an annotation file or a sliding window.
* [Meth_Comp](Meth_Comp/usage): Compare Methylation level between several samples from either `pycoMeth CpG_Aggregate` or `pycoMeth Interval_Aggregate`.
* [CGI_Finder](CGI_Finder/usage): Find CpG islands in a fasta file by using a sliding window and merging overlapping windows satisfying the CpG island definition.

`pycoMeth` generates extensive tabulated reports and BED files which can be loaded in a genome browser. However, this is not a visualisation tool *per se*. An excellent complementary tool to visualise and explore methylation status for specific loci is [`Methplotlib`](https://github.com/wdecoster/methplotlib) developed by [Wouter de coster](https://twitter.com/wouter_decoster).

Please be aware that `pycoMeth` is a research package that is still under development. The API, command line interface, and implementation might change without retro-compatibility.
