**Python package for nanopore DNA methylation analysis downstream to Nanopolish**

`pycoMeth` is a downstream methylation analysis package for [Nanopolish](https://github.com/jts/nanopolish).

It can be used for further analyses of the output files generated by Nanopolish call-methylation.

---

The package contains the following modules:

* [Aggregate](Aggregate/usage) : Aggregate the output of `nanopolish call-methylation` at genomic position level.

**TO BE DEVELOPED**

* CpG_comp : Differential methylation analysis at single CpG level between 2 or multiple samples

* CGI_bin : Find CpG islands (CGI) in a given genome and aggregate CpG level data overlapping each CGI

* CGI_comp : Differential methylation analysis at CpG island level between 2 or multiple samples

* Geno_bin : Bin CpG level in overlapping sliding windows covering the genome

* Geno_comp : Differential methylation analysis at genomic sliding window level between 2 or multiple samples
